### Deep Learning Proposal ###

**Purpose**

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model to identify if a patient is healthy or has pneumonia through X ray images.

**Data**

The Chest X_ray Images dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tolgadincer/labeled-chest-xray-images) which contains 5,856 X ray images of patients with and without pnuemonia will be used.

**Tools**

* Deep learning algorithm (Keras)

**MVP Goal**

Identify the patient in the image has pneunomia or does not have pneumonia.
